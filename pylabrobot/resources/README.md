# Plate naming standard

PLR is not actively enforcing a specific plate naming standard but recommends the following:

<img src="_ims/PLR_plate_naming_standards.png" alt="PLR_plate_naming_standards" width="500"/>

This standard is very similar to the Opentrons API labware naming standard but i.) further sub-categorizes "wellplates" to facilitate communication with day-to-day users, and ii.) adds information about the well-bottom geometry.

| Well types               | Bottom types              |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| - MTP: "micro-titer plate", plates with well volumnes =< 500 ul <br>- DWP: "deep-well plate", plates with well volumnes > 500 ul <br>- reservoir <br>- MWL: "multi-well plate", loose term for plates that don't fall into either of the above categories<br> | - Fb: "flat bottom" <br>- Ub: "U / round bottom" <br>- Fb: "V / conical bottom" <br> |
