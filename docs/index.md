```{note}
PyLabRobot is different from [PyHamilton](https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton). While both packages are created by the same lab and both provide a Python interfaces to Hamilton robots, PyLabRobot aims to provide a universal interface to many different robots runnable on many different computers, where PyHamilton is a Windows only interface to Hamilton's VENUS.
